<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
  Roborampage is a remixable game and set of educational tutorials built in 
  <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/">Thimble</a> using the 
  <a href="http://coquette.maryrosecook.com/">Coquette</a> micro-framework for games.
</p>
<p>
  It aims to hook learners on the power of remixability by letting them:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>change colors through configuration</li>
  <li>customize graphics by editing HTML</li>
  <li>write simple javascript functions to invent player abilities</li>
  <li>create complex functions to modify the whole game</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>
<p>
  Tutorials are delivered in Thimble along with suitably minimized code. You
  can find links in the <a href="/#hack">Hack It</a> section of the main page.
</p>
<p>
  Clicking the link for your desired tutorial will take you to Thimble with
  the tutorial content open in the left-most pane, the code in the middle, and
  a live-preview on the right. You can 
  <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/en-US/project/59570/remix">see an example</a> here.
</p>
<p>
  Editing the code in the middle pane will automatically reload the preview,
  or you can click the "Reload" button above the preview to reload it
  manually.
</p>
<p>
  To play your game in the Thimble preview, you will have to click on the game
  area first to give it focus so that it registers keyboard commands. When you
  are viewing the game without the editor open, the game should automatically
  have focus.
</p>

<h2 id="editing">Free-form Editing</h2>
<p>
  The tutorials try not to overwhelm learners by hiding javascript as necessary
  in script tags. However, if you want to play with the full game source in
  Thimble, you can do so <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/59304/remix">here</a>. 
  A link is also provided in the text at the top of the <a href="/#hack">Hack It</a> 
  section of the main page.
