  <h1>Changing game colors</h1>
  <p>
    There are five colors you can change through configuration settings in the game:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>line 59: the background color</li>
    <li>line 66: the player color while alive</li>
    <li>line 67: the player color when dead</li>
    <li>line 76: the robot color when alive</li>
    <li>line 77: the robot color when dead</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    You can set those variables to anything accepted as a valid canvas <code>fillStyle</code>â€”that's what the game
    is doing under the hood.
    <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Applying_styles_and_colors">This
    MDN article</a> talks about <code>fillStyle</code> and the different ways to set it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simplest option is a string specifying a CSS color.
    The W3C <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#colorunits">CSS Color Module Level 3</a> page provides a full
    explanation of what that means, including color keywords, numerical values, RGB, RGBA, and more. 
    Try changing the background value (line 59) to <code>"midnightblue"</code>. The background should now be a nice deep shade of blue.
    You can also use <code>"#191970"</code>, <code>"rgb(25,25,112)"</code>, or <code>"rgba(25,25,112,1)"</code> to get that same color.
    Use that as a starting point to explore some different possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want a specific color and get tired of guessing at the right RGB value, there are lots of tools and websites
    like <a href="http://www.colorpicker.com/">www.colorpicker.com</a> that can help you, or the more advanced 
    <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com">Adobe Kuler</a> that helps you build palettes as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that <code>fillStyle</code> can also take gradients or patterns. Working with those is a bit beyond the scope
    of this tutorial, but if you want to you can follow the examples in 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Applying_styles_and_colors">the article
    mentioned above</a> to create a gradient or a pattern and assign it where you would have assigned a color. The game canvas has the same
    id as in the examples, so <code>var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');</code> will give you
    the canvas drawing context you need to get started. Feel free to play around, the results may 
    surprise you a little bit.
