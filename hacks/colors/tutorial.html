  <h1>Welcome to the tutorial!</h1>
  <p>
    This tutorial will show you how to change the game colors using its configuration variables. 
    You'll learn a few of the ridiculous ways to express colors on the web, and be able to customize
    the game to your liking.

  <h1>Changeable colors</h1>
  <p>
    There are five colors you can easily control in the game:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>line 52: the background color</li>
    <li>line 59: the player color while alive</li>
    <li>line 60: the player color when dead</li>
    <li>line 69: the robot color when alive</li>
    <li>line 70: the robot color when dead</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The values you see within quotes at those locations are colors, even though they may not look like it.
    Let's try something simple to start...
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Named colors</h1>
  <p class="do-it">
    On line 52, change <code>"#002b36"</code> to be <code>"midnightblue"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Did the background change? The background should have changed. Did it? Good.
  </p>
  <p>
    That worked because <code>midnightblue</code> is a CSS color keyword. Check out 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#colorunits">this page</a> to learn more
    about the basic and extended color keywords.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>peachpuff</code> robots on a field
    of <code>salmon</code>? Go for it, weirdo.

  <h1>Other colors</h1>
  <p>
    There are other ways to talk about colors that the game can understand as well. 
    Take another look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#colorunits">CSS Color Module Level 3</a>
    page I sent you to a moment ago. Anything look familiar? The section on <strong>RGB color values</strong>
    will explain what the original <code>"#002b36"</code> business was all about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Experiment for a while with expressing colors in different ways. Color keywords can only do so much
    for you, but with RGB or HSL you can get a little more specific about the shade of mauve that would
    be just perfect for your palette!
  </p>

  <h1>Going deeper</h1>
  <p>
    So by now your game should be looking pretty great, but maybe you're wondering why you have to express colors
    in these weird and varied ways? Let's go a little bit deeper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under the hood, the game is using an element called a <code>canvas</code> to draw everything to the screen, and
    the colors you are setting are being set as the <code>fillStyle</code> to use on that canvas. 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Applying_styles_and_colors">This
    MDN article</a> talks all about <code>fillStyle</code>, and as you can see, one of the things it can accept
    is a string representing a CSS color. And where do you go to learn about representing CSS colors?
