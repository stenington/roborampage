  <h1>Changing graphics</h1>
  <p>
    Here's a modified version of the game that draws graphics to the screen
    instead of colored squares. Let's look at how it works, and then see
    how to add in graphics of your own!
  </p>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    The new function to draw our player and robots starts on line 65. There's
    a lot of code there, but you don't have to understand it all right now. We'll
    go through it piece by piece throughout this tutorial.
  <p>
  <p>
    On line 105 and line 115 we are telling the game which images to use for the player
    and for the robots respectively. We're fetching images loaded on the page in <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
    tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    The images we want to use are in a new section of the page called "Assets", which
    starts on line 45. There are four images with four distinct ids: <code>player-alive</code>,
    <code>player-dead</code>, <code>robot-alive</code>, and <code>robot-dead</code>. These
    are the graphics the game is using. Try changing the <code>src</code> value of some of them
    to see what happens!
  </p>
  <h2>Collisions</h2>
  <p>
    You might have noticed that robots can collide or even get you without seeing any visual overlap
    on the screen. This is because under the hood, we're detecting collisions using simple squares,
    not pixel-perfect comparison of the images themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might have noticed in the Assets area at the bottom of the page that the images there have pink backgrounds.
    That's showing you the true size of the images you're using, which can differ from the visual size
    if the image has a transparent background. We can show that pink square in the game as well.
    On line 63 there's a variable named <code>showHitArea</code> set to <code>false</code>. Change that
    value to <code>true</code> and see what happens. You should now see translucent pink squares over
    top of the artwork. That's showing you the "hit area" of the player and robots. If the hit area
    of two entities overlaps, a collision has happened.
  </p>
  <h2>Adjusting the hit area</h2>
  <p>
    It's pretty frustrating to die in the game when the robots don't even seem to be touching you,
    so let's fix that. Look at line 70 of the code, inside the new draw function. There's a line
    there setting <code>this.padding</code> to <code>{x:0, y:0}</code> if it hasn't already been
    given a value. That padding will let us shrink the hit area of our graphics to be a smaller
    rectangle inside the graphic itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    To fix the player graphic, go to line 108 and add a new piece of configuration in a new line below it:
    <code>padding: { x: 10, y: 10 }</code>. Don't forget to put a comma on line 108 like <code>},</code>.
    With <code>showHitArea</code> still set to true, see what happens in the game now. The pink square should
    be a bit smaller than the edges of the graphic you are using now! You can use this to shrink down the hit
    area and allow a little bit of overlap before the game considers a collision to have occurred.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also adjust the <code>size</code> parameters of your player and robots on line 103 and line 111. With
    the combination of <code>size</code> and <code>padding</code>, you should be able to make the collision detection
    a little more forgiving, and the game a little more fun to play!
  </p>
  <h2>The draw method</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you've experimented with it, it's time for a full walkthrough of the draw method (line 65).
    This function draws both the players and the robots in the game.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first four lines (line 66 through line 69) choose which image to display from the configuration
    passed in on line 105 and line 115. Players can be dead, whereas robots can be wrecked, so we check
    both conditions to see if we should display the image assigned to <code>dead:</code> or the image
    assigned to <code>alive:</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next five lines (line 70 through line 74) set up the default configuration for the <code>padding</code>
    and calculate the size to display the image given the <code>size</code> you pass in on line 103 and line 111.
  </p>
  <p>
    Line 75 through line 79 draws the image to the screen at the right location and the right size, and line 80 
    through line 86 draws a pink translucent box corresponding to the hit area if we have <code>showHitArea</code>
    turned on.
  </p>

    You can read more about the function <code>drawImage</code> in 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#drawImage()">this article</a>
    on MDN, if you'd like. There are lots of different ways to draw using a canvas element, so feel
    free to try them out if you feel adventurous!
